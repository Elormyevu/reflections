**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?**
A new repository is created (duh). You need to initialize a repository to have a place to store
your work using git.

**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?**
The staging area is the platform from which commits are made.
A snapshot of all files in the staging area is made when one commits; however, only 
files in the repository that have been uploaded to the staging area are committed.
The working directory merely shows files that have been committed.
