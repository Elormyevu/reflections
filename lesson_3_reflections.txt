**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**
This feature will be indispensable for people working on multiple computers. Using Github, they will be able to access all their
commits at one location regardless of the computer they use.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**
You might want to work on a version of your code on Github without sharing it with your computer on git.

**Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?**
Can't answer at the moment; my brain is not really working right now. Extremely sleep deprived and thick brain fog.

**What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?**
I dunno

**How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?**
Nothing would be easier; Everything would be much harder - working with others to edit code, merging edited versions, etc.
