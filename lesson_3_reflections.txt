**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**
This feature will be indispensable for people working on multiple computers. Using Github, they will be able to access all their
commits at one location regardless of the computer they use.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**
You might want to work on a version of your code on Github without sharing it with your computer on git.
